# How to save hosts:


Lets say you have the following hosts: 

52.89.5.222 www.growtopia1.com
52.89.5.222 www.growtopia2.com

When the following prompt shows up

"Hosts(separate new lines using comma): "

You must type the hosts in like this:

52.89.5.222 www.growtopia1.com,52.89.5.222 www.growtopia2.com (the "," replacing the "ENTER" key)
